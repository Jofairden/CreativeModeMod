R3d: Fixed a tiny /itemprefix bug

Pre-Alpha R3:
            
GENERAL:
* Added tModLoader v0.7 support
* Mod should now be readable using the tModReader application
* Simplified /help, non-working arguments now just use ! and optional listed arguments are no longer between brackets {}.
            
BUG FIXES:
* /giveitem works again and now uses edit distance to guess which item you meant (not perfect)
* /npc should no longer spawn npcs an incorrect amount of times

OTHER CHANGES:
* A lot of code has been moved to ModPlayer
* I have rewritten almost everything as try-catch which should translate for easier programming for me, and no crashes for you

GOD MODE:
* /godmode [true|false] or /gm [true|false] now completely shifted to ModPlayer. Remember that true/false can be omitted for fast use!
* You now ignore any contact from mobs, deal quadripled damage and suffer from increased critical strikes.
* Also a neat buff should appear while God mode is active. Eventually I want this to be a crown or divine circlet hovering your character.
* God mode features:
    * Infinite mana and health pool
    * Infinite flight (24 hours)
    * Quadripled damage
    * 100% more critical strike chance
    * No more damage taken by any source, even spikes
    * No more gore and no more damage sound noises
    * No more aggro drawn
    * Ammo is not consumed
    * Immune to all negative debuffs (buffs with a positive effect such as 'Feral Bite' should still work)

TILE RANGE COMMAND:
* /tilerange x [y] or /tr
* Change your tilerange! Set an x and y value and set nothing to return to default.
* eg: /tr 999 999 (999x16 = 15984 tiles.. nuff said)

BUILDER COMMAND:
* /builder or /bm
* Now lets you enter build mode! This mode gives you:
    * Infinite flight (24 hours)
    * Infinite inventory stacks (non-depleting stacks)
    * Infinite tilerange

ITEM PREFIX COMMAND:
* /itemprefix name|type|"list" or /itempre name|type|"list"
* This command sets a prefix on your currently selected item! (eg: /itempre 81 this will give 'Legendary')
* Index ranges from 1 to 83, but you can also enter the name of the prefix! (eg: /itempre legendary)
* Use /itempre list to see all possible prefixes for your selected item

ADDITIONS:
* Added 'day' and 'night' for /time (/time day and /time night)
* Added a teleport to the temple! Use /tp temple
* Added edit distance calculation for /item
* Added /tilerange x y (eg: /tilerange 150 150 use /tilerange or /tr to reset it to your normal values)
* Added skeletron, brain of cthulhu/eater of worlds and eye of cthulhu to /down or /npcd

Sorry for the late update, but it is finally here!
